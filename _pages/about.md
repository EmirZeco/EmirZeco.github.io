Hi, I'm Emir, and welcome to my personal website!

You'll probably find this website to be quite empty. This is because I am a first-year Ph.D. student. My work started on October 1, 2025, at the [Federal Institute for Population Research (BiB)](https://www.bib.bund.de/EN/Home.html), where I am part of the Family and Fertility research area. Specifically, I am working on a DFG-funded research project called “Making Benefits Work. Characteristics and Effects of In-Work Benefits in Different Welfare State Contexts“, together with [Dr. Jan Brülle](https://www.bib.bund.de/EN/Institute/Staff/Bruelle/Bruelle.html).

In my free time, I love listening to music, especially hip-hop, R&B, and pop. I’m a big fan of Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd, and Billie Eilish, and I've had the opportunity to see them live in concert. Outside of music, I enjoy playing video and parlor games, as well as watching football (where I support my favorite team Arsenal F.C.) and Formula 1. I am also interested in national and international politics and fashion.
